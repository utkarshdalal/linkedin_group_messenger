# Purpose

This repo contains a script that allows you to go through people in the same 
groups as you on LinkedIn, lets you filter by location, role and organisation type
and then lets you message them for free.

I used it for sales over LinkedIn without paying for LinkedIn's expensive premium product.

# Instructions
1. Clone the repo
1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. Update variables in the `message.py` script to match the relevant variables for your purpose.
1. `python3 message.py`
